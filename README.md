Proteins are central players in biological processes. Many cellular functions are influenced by the interactions of a protein with other proteins. When these interactions are visualized graphically, they form large, complex networks known as Protein-Protein Interaction Networks (PPI). In these networks, proteins are represented as nodes, and an edge between two nodes indicates an interaction between the proteins.

This repository aims to explore the structural properties of PPI networks, focusing on:

    Small-World and Scale-Free Characteristics: Investigating the global connectivity and hub-like structures of the networks.
    Graph Features: Analysis of network metrics such as degree distribution, clustering coefficients, and network robustness.

Understanding these properties is essential for elucidating the stability of biological systems, which can aid in identifying disease mechanisms and developing therapeutic approaches.
Scope of the Project

This work includes:

    Analysis of Two Selected Proteins:
        Elastin: A protein crucial for tissue elasticity.
        Catalase: An enzyme responsible for breaking down hydrogen peroxide.
    Comparison of Their Networks: To highlight how the biological functions of these proteins influence their interaction network structures.
